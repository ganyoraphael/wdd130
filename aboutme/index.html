     <strong>Raphael Ganyo</strong>
     <p>My name is Raphael Ganyo and am from Ghana in the West Africa. My major is Computer Information Technology. I served my mission is the Nigeria Port Harcourt Mission.
         After my mission, I served in many callings like seminary and institute teacher, clerk and first counsellor to the branch presidency. My favorite quote is by President Gordon B. Hinckley: "The learning process is an endless process. We must read, we must observe, we must assimilate, and we must ponder that to which we expose our minds. I believe in improvement. I believe in growth."
